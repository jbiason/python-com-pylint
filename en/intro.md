# About This Book

This book was designed to try to explain Python through it's kinda-official
static analyser. Because a lot of books just try to teach you Python, they
never dwelt into the kind of issues an static analyser may find; so, although
you're writing Python code, it doesn't mean it's *good* Python code.

## Target

This book is targeted to people who already have some knowledge about
programming. Any language will do. Actually, because some of the issues
reported by Pylint are targeted to people who actually try to write things
like there were using other languages, you may never actually find such issues
if you stick to Python from the very beginning.

## How to read this book

The chapters reflect the easiest to explain problems and go all the way to
the more complex. It doesn't reflect the other Pylint has or the most common
ones.

You could, in theory, use this book to solve some ponctual problem, although,
again, the idea is to explain the whole Python from its errors.
