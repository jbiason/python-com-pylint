# Unnecessary-Semicolon/Multipe-Statements

Python is a language that doesn't require anything special to indicate that a
command ended. While you need to do something like 

```
int var = 1;
```

... in C, in Python you would simply do

```
var = 1
```

As you can see, there is no need to tell Python that the command is done; the
line break will do that to you.

But you may want to add two commands in the same line. To do so, you would
need -- this time -- to actually use `;`

```
var = 2; foo = 3
```

Although this works and it is a valid Python expression, this syntax is
usually frown upon. It doesn't improve readability and reading

```
var = 2
foo = 3
```

Does the same effect. Still, `;` can be used if you're trying to "code golf".
